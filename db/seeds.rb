# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
require 'faker'
#
# artists = 20.times do
#   artist = Faker::Music.band
#   Artist.create({:name => "#{artist}"}) end

# songs = 30.times do
#   title = Faker::Music::Phish.song
#   artist_id = rand(1...10)
#   Song.create({:title => "#{title}", :artist_id => artist_id}) end
